            <h2>Easy Install</h2>
            <h3>Step-By-Step</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Unbox the microphone

                    <ul>
                        <li>Carefully remove all items from the microphone box: microphone, cables, stand (if included), and any accessories.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Attach Microphone Stand

                    <ul>
                        <li>If your microphone came with a stand or clip, screw or attach the microphone to it. This will keep your hands free and stabilize the microphone.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Plug in Cables/Cable

                    <ul>
                        <li>If it's a USB microphone, simply plug the USB cable into your computer's USB port.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If it's an XLR microphone, plug one end of the XLR cable into the microphone and the other end into an audio interface or mixer, which will then connect to your computer or sound system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Adjust Microphone
                    <ul>
                        <li>Position the microphone on your desk or workspace so that it is about 6-12 inches from your mouth. Use a pop filter or windscreen if included to minimize popping sounds.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Select the Microphone as Your Input Device

                    <ul>
                        <li>On your computer:

                            <ol>
                                <li>Open Settings or Control Panel.</li>
                                <li>Go to Sound or Audio Settings.</li>
                                <li>Find the input or recording device section and select your microphone from the list.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Test the Microphone

                    <ul>
                        <li>Open any app that uses a microphone (e.g., voice recorder, video call app, or sound settings).</li>
                        <li>Speak into the microphone to test if your voice is being picked up clearly. Adjust the microphone position if needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Adjust Sound Levels

                    <ul>
                        <li>Go back to Sound Settings and adjust the input volume if your voice is too loud or too quiet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Secure Cables

                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure the cables are neatly arranged and not causing any strain on the microphone. Use cable ties if needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
